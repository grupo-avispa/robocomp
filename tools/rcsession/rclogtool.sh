# Disable termination signals if stdin is not a terminal (https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html):
# - SIGTERM (15): Generic signal used to cause program termination. The normal way to politely ask a program to terminate
# - SIGINT  ( 2): Interrupt signal. Sent when the user types the INTR character (normally Ctrl+c)
# - SIGQUIT ( 3): Quit signal. Similar to SIGINT but controlled by QUIT character (normally Ctrl+\). Produces a core dump when it terminates the process
# - SIGKILL ( 9): Kill signal. Used to cause immediate program termination. It cannot be handled or ignored, and is therefore always fatal
# - SIGHUP  ( 1): Hang-up signal. Used to report that the userâ€™s terminal is disconnected. Also used to report the termination of the controlling process on a terminal to jobs associated with that session
